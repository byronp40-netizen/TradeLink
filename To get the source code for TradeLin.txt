To get the source code for TradeLink onto your own computer, you can typically find a Download or Export button in the top-right corner of this interface (usually look for a cloud icon or a downward arrow).

Once you download the files, here is what you need to know to get it running on your machine:

1. What's in the box?
When you download the project, you’ll get a ZIP file containing all the folders and files we've discussed. This includes the React components, the styling (Tailwind CSS), and the logic that makes the app work.

2. How to run it locally
Since this is a professional web application, it needs a small "engine" to run on your computer.

Install Node.js: Download and install Node.js (it's the standard environment for running modern web apps).
Open the project: Unzip the folder and open it in a code editor like VS Code.
Install Dependencies: Open your computer's terminal (or command prompt) inside that folder and type: npm install
Start the app: Then type: npm run dev
View it: Your terminal will give you a link (usually http://localhost:5173) that you can open in your browser to see TradeLink running locally!
3. Can I just copy-paste?
Absolutely. If you only need a specific part (like the JobCreationFlow.tsx component), you can simply click on that file in the sidebar to your left, select the code, and copy it directly into your own project.

Would you like me to walk you through how to set up a specific part of the code, or are you ready to take the whole project for a spin?
